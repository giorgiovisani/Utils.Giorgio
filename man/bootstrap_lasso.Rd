\title{Function to Test Lasso Stability on a given dataset (uses bootstrap samples)}
\usage{
bootstrap_lasso(boot_idx, dataset, params, model_formula, contrast_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{boot_idx}{Indices f the sampled units in the bootstrap sample}

\item{dataset}{Original Dataset}

\item{params}{List of params (comprising \code{n_folds,stand,train_size,lasso_select})}

\item{model_formula}{Model formula to be used in Lasso Regression}

\item{contrast_list}{List of contrasts to be applied to create the design matrix}
}
\value{
The AUC value of the Lasso Model on the bootstrap dataset,
The list of important varaibles retrieved by Lasso (chooses lambda according to \code{params$lasso_select})
}
\description{
Function to create bootstrap samples of our original dataset,
Divides each bootstrap dataset into Train and Test (keeping the same ratio for the response variable),
Performs normalization of the variables (transforming in the range [0,1]), if \code{params$stand} is set to \code{TRUE}
Otherwise, the standardization is done inside the Lasso model, using the \eqn{\frac{X-\bar{x}}{\sigma}}
Creates the model matrix as given by the formula (this way, we may specify interactions and how to encode categorical variables)
Performs Lasso using cross-validation (with number of folds as assigned in \code{params})
Returns the value of AUC and the list of important variables retrieved by Lasso in the bootstrap sample
